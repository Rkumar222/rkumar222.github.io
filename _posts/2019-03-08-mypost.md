# [Adobe XD (Presentation) Week 4]({% post_url 2019-03-08-mypost %})
Hello This is Ravinder Kumar and This is my blog post.

## Progress:
In the last week i've completed my design part for the farmscare mobile application.In this week i've done the prototype and also there were some errors in design which i found when making prototype. I fixed all the error and i think design is error free. One Feature i would like to mention that adobe xd offers is you can use your voice command to run the prototye, i really like this one.

After the completion of my project, i've just started working on my prestation.

Here is the live link to my presentation:
