# [Adobe XD (Presentation) Week 3]({% post_url 2019-03-01-mypost %})
Hello This is Ravinder Kumar and This is my blog post.

## Progress:

I have completed the design part for my Framscare app. I have used an icon for that which is made by me using illustrator. Actually, it's the icon i've created for my team project, so i decided to use it here because it's the app related to project. The design is created by me for my project B presentation only my team has their design.

I like working on Adobe XD, it's an amazing experience for me. The most of the things we need to make a great design for an app or website are available in UI kits. I also took advantage of that kits. They are available for windows and mac as well on adobe website.but you must have good knowledge to use them, don't worry about that adobe has provided tutorials for that. While working on Adobe XD, i get to know about how simple design is, if you have necessary things handy with you like buttons, text areas, icons, symbols etc.

As i have complete my design part Iâ€™ll start working on Prototype and  Presentation.
