## Topic: Mobile Prototype for Farming mobile app Using Adobe 

I chose Adobe XD to make the prototype for my Farmcare mobile app.The mobile app design is going to be about crops, weather conditions for farmers. I opted for Adovbe XD because it is one of the trending software for designing interactive web and mobile layouts. Adobe XD is having a clean user interface and is quite easy to use, even for the beginners. While researching for Adobe XD website, I found that it is having various interactive features like using animations, adobe plugins for better functionality, easy to share and use designs on windows or mac, and it's cloud based which gives us more freedom to work anywhere at any place.I have also started watching webinars for Adobe XD on Lynda.com and learning about making my mobile app look good. Moreover, I am also looking into tutorials provided on Adobe's website. Adobe XD's new Repeat Grid feature enables you to repeat elements quickly and explore different designs. Adobe XD introduces a brand new Pen tool that enables you to quickly draw paths.
